  volume   = {309},
  abstract = {Olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) are unique glia that support axon outgrowth in the olfactory system, and when used as cellular therapy after spinal cord injury, improve recovery and axon regeneration. Here we assessed the effects of combining OEC transplantation with another promising therapy, epidural electrical stimulation during a rehabilitative motor task. Sprague-Dawley rats received a mid-thoracic transection and transplantation of OECs or fibroblasts (FBs) followed by lumbar stimulation while climbing an inclined grid. We injected pseudorabies virus (PRV) into hindlimb muscles 7 months post-injury to assess connectivity across the transection. Analyses showed that the number of serotonergic (5-HT) axons that crossed the rostral scar border and the area of neurofilament-positive axons in the injury site were both greater in OEC- than FB-treated rats. We detected PRV-labeled cells rostral to the transection and remarkable evidence of 5-HT and PRV axons crossing the injury site in 1 OEC- and 1 FB-treated rat. The axons that crossed suggested either axon regeneration (OEC) or small areas of probable tissue sparing (FB). Most PRV-labeled thoracic neurons were detected in laminae VII or X, and {\textasciitilde}25\% expressed Chx10, a marker for V2a interneurons. These findings suggest potential regeneration or sparing of circuits that connect thoracic interneurons to lumbar somatic motor neurons. Despite evidence of axonal connectivity, no behavioral changes were detected in this small-scale study. Together these data suggest that when supplemented with epidural stimulation and climbing, OEC transplantation can increase axonal growth across the injury site and may promote recovery of propriospinal circuitry.},

  title    = {A kinetic analysis of mouse rod and cone photoreceptor responses},
  volume   = {598},
  abstract = {Most vertebrates have rod and cone photoreceptors, which differ in their sensitivity and response kinetics. We know that rods evolved from cone-like precursors through the expression of different transduction genes or the same genes at different levels, but we do not know which molecular differences were most important. We have approached this problem in mouse retina by analysing the kinetic differences between rod flash responses and recent voltage-clamp recordings of cone flash responses, using a model incorporating the principal features of photoreceptor transduction. We apply a novel method of analysis using the log-transform of the current, and we ask which of the model's dynamic parameters need be changed to transform the flash response of a rod into that of a cone. The most important changes are a decrease in the gain of the response, reflecting a reduction in amplification of the transduction cascade; an increase in the rate of turnover of cGMP in darkness; and an increase in the rate of decay of activated phosphodiesterase, with perhaps also an increase in the rate of decay of light-activated visual pigment. Although we cannot exclude other differences, and in particular alterations in the Ca2+ economy of the photoreceptors, we believe that we have identified the kinetic parameters principally responsible for the differences in the flash responses of the two kinds of photoreceptors, which were likely during evolution to have resulted in the duplex retina.},

  abstract  = {Rationale
               Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is characterized by lung inflammation, edema, and severe hypoxemia. In previous work, we showed that IL-1b is required for the development of severe hypoxemia in a murine model of acute lung injury, independent of measures of inflammation and edema. We hypothesized that IL-1b is altering the regulation of pulmonary blood flow to cause severe V/Q mismatching in acute lung injury. To explore possible mechanisms for this, we studied the effects of IL-1b on calcium flux in human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (hPASMCs) in response to the vasoconstrictor endothelin-1 (ET-1).
               
               Methods
               hPASMCs were grown on glass bottom dishes to confluence and some dishes were treated with IL-1b (10ng/mL) for 3h. Cells were loaded with 5mM Cal-520 and stimulated with ET-1 (10nM) during fluorescent imaging on a Zeiss LSM confocal microscope. All cells from each field were individually selected using Fiji image analysis software. By visual inspection, we noticed that a marked number of cells showed oscillations in calcium flux after ET-1. To quantify oscillatory from non-oscillatory responses, we used a mixture of information theoretic and machine learning algorithms and developed a custom classifier tool. We applied this tool to our control and IL-1b-treated data (Figure 1) and created a contingency table for the effects of IL-1b on the induction of oscillatory responses. χ2 confidence intervals and statistical significance were computed by bootstrap simulation with 105 replicates using custom scripts in R(v3.4.1).
               
               Results
               In control dishes (n = 6), there were a total of 444 non-oscillators cells and 379 oscillator cells. In dishes treated with IL-1b (n = 2), there were 50 non-oscillator cells and 211 oscillators total. A bootstrap simulation based χ2 test was performed and a strong relationship was found between IL-1b treatment and the presence of oscillatory responses, χ2 = 96.7 (71.2, 125.5; 95\% C.I.), p {\textless} 10−5.},

  title    = {Mechanisms of {Detection} {Sensitivity} and {Adaptation} in the {Rod} {Visual} {Pathway}},
  abstract = {Vision begins in the retina, where photoreceptors have the task of discriminating incomingphotons from intrinsic cellular noise. Vertebrates have evolved a duplex retina, in which rod and cone photoreceptors respond over a broad range of light intensities from single photons to bright light. Rods evolved from less sensitive cone-like photoreceptors and are responsible for mediating the lowest 8 orders of magnitude of light intensity. At the lowest threshold of vision, rods detect single photons and transmit signals to downstream neurons in a specialized circuit. In the rod visual pathway, tens of rods converge onto a single rod bipolar cell, where noise from the rods is filtered, and rod signals are processed for further downstream transmission. It is unclear which evolutionary changes imparted such sensitivity to rods, and how these advantages allow for rods to discriminate single photons from intrinsic noise. In downstream bipolar cells, the mechanism for setting the filtering threshold is unknown. Further, it is unclear what implications of the thresholding of rod bipolar cells have on vision in scotopic light levels. In this thesis, I investigated the mechanisms that work together to define the threshold of vision. To gain understanding of the nature of vision at the absolute threshold, I worked with three main goals in mind: • Goal 1: Determine the set of changes that make feasible the incredible sensitivity of rods. • Goal 2: Assess contributions of transduction proteins to the detection of single photons versus intrinsic noise. • Goal 3: Measure the ability of rod bipolar cells to shape and parse rod signals over several orders of magnitude of ambient light levels. To achieve these goals, I collected single-cell electrophysiological from mouse rods and rod bipolar cells. I analyzed the data with statistical models to determine parameters that described the mechanisms of visual threshold and adaptation. I also used statistical modeling to help validate results of mathematical modeling from our collaborators in the Reingruber Lab (Paris, France), which show that the important differences between rods and cones are reflected in the cone as a reduced outer segment volume, a decreased amplification through the transduction cascade, a faster turnover rate of the cyclic guanosine monophosphate second messenger, and an accelerated rate of decay of the phosphodiesterase (PDE) enzyme (goal 1). Through analysis of intrinsic noise in rods, I showed that PDE is the critical transduction element both setting the noise level and limiting the detection threshold and variability for single-photon absorptions (goal 2). Further, measurements in rod bipolar cells revealed that rod bipolar cells have a calcium-dependent feedback mechanism that allows rod bipolar cells to respond robustly to single-photon absorptions in the minority of the rods, while continuing to signal in brighter backgrounds that also cause rod adaptation (goal 3). Taken together, my work has helped delineate the fundamental mechanisms of signal detection and processing at the threshold of vision and over the dynamic range of rod vision.},

  abstract = {Purpose: To elucidate the molecular events in solute carrier family 4 member 11 (SLC4A11)-deficient corneal endothelium that lead to the endothelial dysfunction that characterizes the dystrophies associated with SLC4A11 mutations, congenital hereditary endothelial dystrophy (CHED) and Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy 4.
              
              Methods: Comparative transcriptomic analysis (CTA) was performed in primary human corneal endothelial cells (pHCEnC) and murine corneal endothelial cells (MCEnC) with normal and reduced levels of SLC4A11 (SLC4A11 KD pHCEnC) and Slc4a11 (Slc4a11−/− MCEnC), respectively. Validation of differentially expressed genes was performed using immunofluorescence staining of CHED corneal endothelium, as well as western blot and quantitative PCR analysis of SLC4A11 KD pHCEnC and Slc4a11−/− MCEnC. Functional analyses were performed to investigate potential functional changes associated with the observed transcriptomic alterations.
              
              Results: CTA revealed inhibition of cell metabolism and ion transport function as well as mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to reduced adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production, in SLC4A11 KD pHCEnC and Slc4a11−/− MCEnC. Co-localization of SNARE protein STX17 with mitochondria marker COX4 was observed in CHED corneal endothelium, as was activation of AMPK–p53/ULK1 in both SLC4A11 KD pHCEnC and Slc4a11−/− MCEnC, providing additional evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction and mitophagy. Reduced Na+-dependent HCO3− transport activity and altered NH4Cl-induced membrane potential changes were observed in Slc4a11−/− MCEnC.
              
              Conclusions: Reduced steady-state ATP levels and subsequent activation of the AMPK–p53 pathway provide a link between the metabolic functional deficit and transcriptome alterations, as well as evidence of insufficient ATP to maintain the Na+/K+-ATPase corneal endothelial pump as the cause of the edema that characterizes SLC4A11-associated corneal endothelial dystrophies.},

  abstract = {Circadian rhythms in core body temperature (CBT) have been widely studied, but fewer studies have explored higher-frequency (ultradian) rhythms in detail. We analyzed CBT recordings from young and middle-aged wild-type mice as well as from the Q175 model of Huntington's disease (HD), at sufficient temporal resolution to address the question of ultradian rhythms. We used model selection methods to show that the overall circadian pattern was better fit by a square wave than a sine wave. Then, using Fourier analysis of the CBT rhythms, we identified the spectral signature of an 8-hour oscillation that occurs in the night but not the day, an observation that can be confirmed by direct inspection of the rhythms. This diurnal amplitude modulation of the 8-hour rhythm was lost with aging as well as in the HD model. Thus, the impact of aging and disease is seen here in the loss of the ability to separate rhythms into a daytime phase and a nighttime phase. These findings raise the possibility that ultradian rhythms in CBT may be a useful biomarker for the pathology within the central nervous system.},

  title    = {Rod bipolar cell contributions to changes in response sensitivity during light adaptation},
  volume   = {62},
  abstract = {Purpose : Mammalian rod bipolar cells desensitize with increases in mean luminance. This process of light adaptation reflects the sum of presynaptic gain changes in rods and postsynaptic changes in the mGluR6 signaling cascade. Here we dissect these contributions and study their underlying mechanism by measuring the properties of light-evoked signals in both rods and rod bipolar cells using patch electrodes.
              
              Methods : Whole-cell voltage clamp recordings were made from rod photoreceptors and rod bipolar cells in dark-adapted mouse retinal slices. Light-evoked responses were recorded for a series of flashes in darkness and during the presentation of background light up to 400 Rh* (activated rhodopsins) rod-1 sec-1. A Hill equation with three free parameters was fit to the rod bipolar cell response-intensity relationship - including the maximum photocurrent (Rmax), the half-maximal flash strength (k), and the extent of nonlinearity in response amplitude as a function of flash strength (n).
              
              Results : Rod photoreceptors exhibited a 2-fold loss of sensitivity at light intensities that cause {\textasciitilde}50 Rh* sec-1. Downstream rod bipolar cells exhibit a more complicated sensitivity change. In dim backgrounds, n was reduced from a value of 1.6 in darkness to 1.0 by approximately 10 Rh* rod-1 sec-1. At brighter light intensities, k began to shift, reflecting the decline in rod sensitivity. Rmax was also reduced by up to 60\% at the brightest backgrounds tested. Dialysis of 10mM BAPTA during recordings, or holding the membrane potential at +50mV, reduced this modulation. Nonstationary noise analysis of the falling phase of light-evoked responses elicited in darkness and in background light reveal that the reduction in Rmax does not arise from a reduced TRPM1 single-channel current. Instead, it must result from a reduction in the coupling between the mGluR6 receptors and TRPM1 channels.
              
              Conclusions : Measurements in mouse rod bipolar cells reveal that the loss in sensitivity as a function of background light is a combination of the loss in sensitivity due to rod phototransduction, along with mechanisms intrinsic to the rod bipolar cell dendrites. These collectively allow rod bipolar cells to respond robustly to single photon absorptions in a minority of the rods, while continuing the signal at brighter lights that also cause rod adaptation.},

              Methods : Human SLC4A11-/- CEnC lines were generated by CRISPR-Cas9 mediated gene editing. SLC4A11 wildtype (SLC4A11WT) and SLC4A11 mutant (SLC4A11MU) human CEnC lines were generated by stable transduction with lentiviruses containing either SLC4A11WT or SLC4A11MU expression vectors harboring CHED-/FECD4-associated SLC4A11 mutations (CHED: c.374G{\textgreater}A, c.1813C{\textgreater}T, c.2263C{\textgreater}T; FECD4: c.2224G{\textgreater}A). Functional assays were performed to assess cell migration, proliferation, viability after induced oxidative stress and NH4Cl-induced membrane conductance in the generated SLC4A11WT, SLC4A11MU and SLC4A11-/- CEnC lines. Cell barrier function in SLC4A11WT and SLC4A11-/- CEnC were assessed by electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS). Immunostaining was performed to determine the subcellular localization of SLC4A11 protein in the generated SLC4A11WT and SLC4A11MU CEnC lines and human primary CEnC.
              
              Results : SLC4A11-/- CEnC and the majority of the SLC4A11MU CEnC lines exhibited significantly increased migration rates, altered proliferation, and decreased cell viability under oxidative stress compared to SLC4A11WT CEnC. Induction with 10mM NH4Cl led SLC4A11WT CEnC to depolarize; conversely, SLC4A11-/- CEnC hyperpolarized and the majority of SLC4A11MU CEnC either hyperpolarized or had minimal membrane potential changes following NH4Cl induction. Based on ECIS modeling, SLC4A11WT CEnC demonstrated increased cell-substrate adhesion and membrane capacitances compared to SLC4A11-/- CEnC. Immunostaining of primary CEnC and SLC4A11WT CEnC lines for SLC4A11 demonstrated predominately cell surface staining with partial colocalization with mitochondrial marker COX4 within punctate subcellular structures. SLC4A11MU CEnC lines also displayed mainly cell surface staining of SLC4A11, except for SLC4A11MU c.2263C{\textgreater}T CEnC, which exhibited mostly perinuclear staining.
              
              Conclusions : CHED- and FECD4-associated SLC4A11 mutations likely lead to CEnC dysfunction, and ultimately CHED and FECD4, by interfering with cell migration, proliferation, viability, membrane conductance, barrier function, and/or cell surface localization of the SLC4A11 protein in CEnC.},

  abstract = {Multiple neural and peripheral cell types rapidly respond to tissue damage after spinal cord injury to form a structurally and chemically inhibitory scar that limits axon regeneration. Astrocytes form an astroglial scar and produce chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs), activate microglia, and recruit blood-derived immune cells to the lesion for debris removal. One beneficial therapy, olfactory ensheathing cell (OEC) transplantation, results in functional improvements and promotes axon regeneration after spinal cord injury. The lack of an OEC-specific marker, however, has limited the investigation of mechanisms underlying their proregenerative effects. We compared the effects of enhanced green fluorescent protein-labeled fibroblast (FB) and OEC transplants acutely after a complete low-thoracic spinal cord transection in adult rats. We assessed the preservation of neurons and serotonergic axons, the levels of inhibitory CSPGs and myelin debris, and the extent of immune cell activation between 1 and 8 weeks postinjury. Our findings indicate that OECs survive longer than FBs post-transplantation, preserve axons and neurons, and reduce inhibitory molecules in the lesion core. Additionally, we show that OECs limit immune-cell activation and infiltration, whereas FBs alter astroglial scar formation and increase immune-cell infiltration and concomitant secondary tissue damage. Administration of cyclosporine-A to enhance graft survival demonstrated that immune suppression can augment OEC contact-mediated protection of axons and neurons during the first 2 weeks postinjury. Collectively, these data suggest that OECs have neuroprotective and immunomodulatory mechanisms that create a supportive environment for neuronal survival and axon regeneration after spinal cord injury.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Spinal cord injury creates physical and chemical barriers to axon regeneration. We used a complete spinal cord transection model and olfactory ensheathing cell (OEC) or fibroblast (FB; control) transplantation as a repair strategy. OECs, but not FBs, intermingled with astrocytes, facilitated astroglial scar border formation and sequestered invading peripheral cells. OECs attenuated immune cell infiltration, reduced secondary tissue damage, protected neurons and axons in the lesion core, and helped clear myelin debris. Immunosuppression enhanced survival of OECs and FBs, but only OEC transplantation promoted scaffold formation in the lesion site that facilitated axon regeneration and neuron preservation.},
