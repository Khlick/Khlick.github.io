- Co-created and lectured an undergraduate course named Life Sciences 40: Statistics for life sciences that focused on Monte Carlo simulation
(bootstrap) methods. This course was highly successful and remains a popular course in the Life Sciences.
- Managed and created all course materials, including lectures, labs, and exams. I prepared and gave lecture 3 hours per week, and developed
a 2-hour weekly, Python-based, computational lab for 86 undergraduates.
- Leveraged Python notebooks to teach students to develop algorithms for analyzing biological data. Students gained understanding of
statistical principles for experimental-data analysis with probability distributions, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, statistical
independence, linear regression, ANOVA, statistical power and experimental design.
