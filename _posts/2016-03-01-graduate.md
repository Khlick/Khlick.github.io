- Identified and characterized the molecular basis for noise in rod photoreceptors and its implications on the threshold of photon detection
by leveraging genetic, electrophysiological and statistical tools.
- Distinguished contributions of rod bipolar neurons to adaptation in the rod visual pathway, and identified the TRPM1-channel protein
as a potential target for calcium that controls the boundary between rapid and prolonged adaptation to continuous light.
- In addition to thesis work funded by T32 training grant (T32EY07026, 2018 â€“ 2021), I collaborated with internal and external labs to
UCLA where I contributed statistical and experimental work to the successful funding from 4 different NIH grants, 3 publications ([Zhang _et al._ 2020](https://khrisgriffis.com/publications/zhang2020.html),
[Reingruber _et al._ 2020](https://khrisgriffis.com/publications/reingruber2020.html), [Griffis _et al._ 2022](https://khrisgriffis.com/publications/griffis2022a.html)) and several conference abstracts ([Griffis & Sampath 2021](https://khrisgriffis.com/publications/griffis2021.html), [Chung _et al._ 2022](https://khrisgriffis.com/publications/chung2022.html), for example).
- Developed an open-source, MATLAB-based analysis framework and GUI, named [Iris DVA](https://github.com/sampath-lab-ucla/IrisDVA), for transparent, documentable, and replicable analysis of physiological data.
- Developed and supported custom hardware and software for precision control over light stimuli, for use in microspectrophotometry,
electroretinography, and single-cell patch physiology rigs.
