## Abstract:

Circadian rhythms in core body temperature (CBT) have been
widely studied, but fewer studies have explored higher-frequency
(ultradian) rhythms in detail. We analyzed CBT recordings from young
and middle-aged wild-type mice as well as from the Q175 model of
Huntington's disease (HD), at sufficient temporal resolution to
address the question of ultradian rhythms. We used model selection
methods to show that the overall circadian pattern was better fit by
a square wave than a sine wave. Then, using Fourier analysis of the
CBT rhythms, we identified the spectral signature of an 8-hour
oscillation that occurs in the night but not the day, an observation
that can be confirmed by direct inspection of the rhythms. This
diurnal amplitude modulation of the 8-hour rhythm was lost with
aging as well as in the HD model. Thus, the impact of aging and
disease is seen here in the loss of the ability to separate rhythms
into a daytime phase and a nighttime phase. These findings raise the
possibility that ultradian rhythms in CBT may be a useful biomarker
for the pathology within the central nervous system.
