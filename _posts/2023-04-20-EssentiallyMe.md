Hello, I'm so glad you found this page. My name is Khris. I have a Ph.D. from the University of California, Los Angles, in the field of Molecular, Cellular, and Integrative Physiology. My area of expertise is in visual neuroscience. My [doctoral work](https://khrisgriffis.com/publications/griffis2022b.html) investigated molecular mechanisms of photon detection and processing in the mammalian rod visual pathway ({% cite griffis_mechanisms_2022 %}).
