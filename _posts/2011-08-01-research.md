- In the laboratories of Patricia E. Phelps and V. Reggie Edgerton, I investigated the therapeutic use of olfactory ensheathing cells (OEC) transplantation for spinal cord injury which resulted in 2 publications ([Khankan _et al._ 2016](https://khrisgriffis.com/publications/khankan2016.html) & [Thornton _et al._ 2018](https://khrisgriffis.com/publications/thornton2018.html)) and 4 conference abstracts.
- Managed and assisted in surgical implantation of stimulating and recording electrodes for behavioral experiments that assessed longterm
functional recovery following spinal cord injury in rats.
- Leveraged experience in histology, immunochemistry, microscopy, statistical modeling, and machine learning to show functional recovery
in spinal cord injured rats which received OEC transplantation had enhanced regeneration when combined with epidural (spinal) stimulation and climb-task training.
