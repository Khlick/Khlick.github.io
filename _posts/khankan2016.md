## Abstract

Multiple neural and peripheral cell types rapidly respond to
tissue damage after spinal cord injury to form a structurally and
chemically inhibitory scar that limits axon regeneration. Astrocytes
form an astroglial scar and produce chondroitin sulfate
proteoglycans (CSPGs), activate microglia, and recruit blood-derived
immune cells to the lesion for debris removal. One beneficial
therapy, olfactory ensheathing cell (OEC) transplantation, results
in functional improvements and promotes axon regeneration after
spinal cord injury. The lack of an OEC-specific marker, however, has
limited the investigation of mechanisms underlying their
proregenerative effects. We compared the effects of enhanced green
fluorescent protein-labeled fibroblast (FB) and OEC transplants
acutely after a complete low-thoracic spinal cord transection in
adult rats. We assessed the preservation of neurons and serotonergic
axons, the levels of inhibitory CSPGs and myelin debris, and the
extent of immune cell activation between 1 and 8 weeks postinjury.
Our findings indicate that OECs survive longer than FBs
post-transplantation, preserve axons and neurons, and reduce
inhibitory molecules in the lesion core. Additionally, we show that
OECs limit immune-cell activation and infiltration, whereas FBs
alter astroglial scar formation and increase immune-cell
infiltration and concomitant secondary tissue damage. Administration
of cyclosporine-A to enhance graft survival demonstrated that immune
suppression can augment OEC contact-mediated protection of axons and
neurons during the first 2 weeks postinjury. Collectively, these
data suggest that OECs have neuroprotective and immunomodulatory
mechanisms that create a supportive environment for neuronal
survival and axon regeneration after spinal cord injury.

### SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT 
Spinal cord injury creates physical and chemical barriers
to axon regeneration. We used a complete spinal cord transection
model and olfactory ensheathing cell (OEC) or fibroblast (FB;
control) transplantation as a repair strategy. OECs, but not FBs,
intermingled with astrocytes, facilitated astroglial scar border
formation and sequestered invading peripheral cells. OECs attenuated
immune cell infiltration, reduced secondary tissue damage, protected
neurons and axons in the lesion core, and helped clear myelin
debris. Immunosuppression enhanced survival of OECs and FBs, but
only OEC transplantation promoted scaffold formation in the lesion
site that facilitated axon regeneration and neuron preservation.
