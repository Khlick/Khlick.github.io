- Led 1 experimental and 1 in silico project investigating the molecular origin of photoreceptor discrete- and continuous-noise (2 firstauthor
manuscripts in final preparations).
- Combined machine learning methods with electrophysiological recordings of single-photon responses to identify phosphodiesterase as
the driver for photon-detection limits in rod photoreceptors.
- Mentored and trained a small team of post doc and staff research personnel on custom acquisition hardware, analysis software, and
data analysis theory and methodology.
