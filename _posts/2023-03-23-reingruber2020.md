## Abstract:
Most vertebrates have rod and cone photoreceptors, which
differ in their sensitivity and response kinetics. We know that rods
evolved from cone-like precursors through the expression of
different transduction genes or the same genes at different levels,
but we do not know which molecular differences were most important.
We have approached this problem in mouse retina by analysing the
kinetic differences between rod flash responses and recent
voltage-clamp recordings of cone flash responses, using a model
incorporating the principal features of photoreceptor transduction.
We apply a novel method of analysis using the log-transform of the
current, and we ask which of the model's dynamic parameters need be
changed to transform the flash response of a rod into that of a
cone. The most important changes are a decrease in the gain of the
response, reflecting a reduction in amplification of the
transduction cascade; an increase in the rate of turnover of cGMP in
darkness; and an increase in the rate of decay of activated
phosphodiesterase, with perhaps also an increase in the rate of
decay of light-activated visual pigment. Although we cannot exclude
other differences, and in particular alterations in the Ca2+ economy
of the photoreceptors, we believe that we have identified the
kinetic parameters principally responsible for the differences in
the flash responses of the two kinds of photoreceptors, which were
likely during evolution to have resulted in the duplex retina.
